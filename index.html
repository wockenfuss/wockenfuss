					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
						I'm an educator and media artist originally from the Motor City. 
					</p>
					<p> 
						My wife and I recently moved to the Bay Area from the Cream City. In order to fit in, we just bought a <i>Prius</i>. 
					</p>
					<p>	
						As a way of learning <i>Ruby on Rails</i>, I've started building a web interface for one of my online classes. It's still in the very early stages, but you can scope it out <a href="http://concepts-in-media-production.herokuapp.com">here.</a>  
					</p>
					<p>	
						The image of the cat is from one of my all-time favorite films: <i>Sans Soleil</i>, by Chris Marker, who recently died at the age of 91.
